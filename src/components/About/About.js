                <p>Hello, I am Zachary, 23 year old male. I am currently studying Web Developing at Adelaide Uni
                    Bootcamp. My goal is too develop my currently
                    skills and hopefully find a new career path. What made me so interested in Web Developing
                    was I have had previous html studies before at TAFE SA. I found it was so interesting that I wanted
                    to persue it even further.
                </p> 
                <p>I am fun cheerful person. Some of my hobbies are video gaming, watching NBA and going
